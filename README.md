 a first discord bot that's not advanced

as always look in config to change stuff

do not expect perfect code it's first actual project I put semi-a lot of work into that I didn't end up using. Uses a local db sqlite so be weary of installing that and make sure to look through all the files to edit or change things you might need to because I put watermarks on the embeds. 

Also, has a >add [user id] command that lets people who are added have access to all the commands so yea, it can be repurposed and improved it can be used for moderation or tickets with its pasted ticket system cause fuck working with message reactions in discord js

if you for some reason need help add me on discord
